### Bridging Logic and Design

**Software Development | Data Science** <br>
I treat software development and data science as distinct fields that harmonize in execution. <br>
My workflow is inspired by music production: I think in components and build systems layer by layer — from the initial arrangement to the final master.

## About Me

* **Project Philosophy:** I plan projects like an arrangement – structure, timing, and recognizability are crucial. Only when all components interlock harmoniously does a maintainable product emerge.
* **Backend & Quality:** Building reliable systems using Onion Architecture and Clean Code. Quality is defined by reliability, supported by a testing suite including JUnit, Mockito, AssertJ, and ArchUnit.
* **Data Science:** Prioritizing logic and actionable results over complex visualizations. I prefer a straightforward, pragmatic approach to code and problem-solving.
* **Current Development:** Sharpening React skills to complement backend expertise, while exploring AWS, AI, and Go.
